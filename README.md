## Customer Churn Prediction
An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts customer churn using XGBoost, built with a modular pipeline, Jupyter notebooks for analysis, and a Streamlit web app for deployment. This project demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, model tuning, evaluation, and deployment.

### Objective
Predict whether a customer is likely to churn (cancel their service) based on account and usage features. The goal is to help businesses reduce customer loss and improve retention through data-driven actions.

### Business Impact
- Customer retention costs are significantly lower than acquiring new users.  
- Early churn detection enables targeted offers and proactive customer support.  
- Predictive analytics improve customer lifetime value and overall profitability.

### Project Workflow

   1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

      * Analyzed feature distributions and churn trends.
      * Identified missing values and data imbalances.

   2. **Preprocessing Pipeline**

      * Encoded categorical and binary features.
      * Scaled numerical variables.
      * Built modular functions for reproducibility.

   3. **Model Training and Tuning**

      * Compared baseline models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
      * Used RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
      * Handled class imbalance with `scale_pos_weight`.

   4. **Model Evaluation**

      * Measured performance with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
      * Selected the tuned XGBoost model (Round 2) for final deployment.

   5. **Deployment**

      * Developed a Streamlit web app for live predictions.
      * Users can input customer data and receive churn probability.

### Model Performance

| Metric            | Round 1 | Round 2 (Final) |
| :---------------- | :-----: | :-------------: |
| Accuracy          |   0.75  |       0.78      |
| Recall (Churn)    |   0.81  |       0.73      |
| Precision (Churn) |   0.52  |       0.56      |
| F1 (Churn)        |   0.64  |       0.63      |

**Final Model:** Tuned XGBoost (Round 2) — more balanced precision and recall.

### Key Learnings

   * Designed a modular, reusable ML pipeline.
   * Handled class imbalance using `scale_pos_weight`.
   * Tuned hyperparameters effectively with cross-validation.
   * Built and deployed a working Streamlit web app for predictions.
   * Practiced clean project structure and documentation for reproducibility.
